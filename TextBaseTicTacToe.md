This is a classic two-player game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and visually appealing user interface, where the goal is to fill a row, column, or diagonal with three of the same symbols either X's or O's on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns selecting an empty square to place their symbol, with the first player to align three of their symbols in a straight line winning the game.
